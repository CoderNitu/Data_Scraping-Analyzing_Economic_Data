1. Sending HTTP requests to the URL of the targeted webpage to get the HTML file using requests or "requests" or "httpx" libraries in Python.
2. Parse the HTML file to easily iterate and extract data using Python HTML parser like "html.parser" or "lxml".
3. Then use functions like find and find_all in Python to extract the required data from the parsed HTML file.
4. The extracted data can be stored in various formats, such as CSV files, databases, or JSON objects.
